Argos Academic System — Formal Verification Summary
===================================================

Invariant Verified:
-------------------
"No student may be enrolled in overlapping sections."

Verification Steps:
-------------------
1. Implemented critical invariant function:
       check_no_time_overlap()
2. Integrated invariant into runtime monitor:
       RuntimeMonitor.validate_timetable()
3. Formal specification (pseudo TLA+):
       Provided in formal_model.py
4. Automated tests executed:
       - Valid timetable
       - Overlap detection
       - Edge cases
       - Multiple section scenarios

Result:
-------
Invariant holds under all tested valid cases.
Violations correctly detected and raised as InvariantViolation.
